notes: >-
  "Greg says it's 'pretty good,' 'minty,' 'trying to be refreshing,' but also
  'weird,' 'salty,' and 'smoky,' with a 'cheesiness of the aftertaste' that he
  doesn't like. He calls it 'a cocktail with an identity crisis.'"
  Origin: A Mojito riff with Doritos Nacho Cheese Vodka, Mountain Dew, lime,
  mint, and simple syrup, created as an experiment in savory, minty cocktails.
